# Data Science Portfolio 

## Here are some of the projects that I have done through my data science degree at The University of Warwick

### Psychological Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic

Third-year project, supervised by Dr Martine Barons. Conducte large scale data analyses on two data sets to investigate the impacts of the pandemic and the mental health implications of the crisis. Most of this was done using R to celan and preprocesss the data, followed by visualisation and statistical model fitting. Further, a Bayesian Network (Bayes Net) was also used to model the data using the Netica software.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales


Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
