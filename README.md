# Data Science Portfolio 

## Hi There! Here are some of the projects that I have done through my data science degree at The University of Warwick

### Psychological Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic

In the academic year 2022/2023, I embarked on a compelling data science project that aimed to unravel the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a specific focus on the mental health of UK university students. Supervised by Dr. Martine Barons at the University of Warwick, this project employed advanced data science methodologies to analyze and interpret the effects of the pandemic on the well-being of students.

Most of this was done using **R** to clean and preprocesss the data, followed by visualisation and statistical model fitting. Further, a **Bayesian Network** (Bayes Net) was also used to model the data using the Netica software.

#### Results

The analysis revealed noteworthy findings, indicating that the mental health of UK university students was adversely affected in 2020 compared to previous years. Demographic factors such as age, gender, and changes in working hours in Australia were also identified as significant contributors to variations in mental well-being.

### Survival Analysis of Patients in the METABRIC Study

Using **R** to perform missing data analysis and survival analysis of data about breast cancer. The main aim is to model the time until an event has happened and to find relationships between different clinical factors and patient's length of survival.

This project allowed me to follow my interest of medical statistics and apply my knowledge and skills in an area of importance for many people.

#### Key words
Regression; Survival Analysis; Breast Cancer; Missing Data; Random Forest Imputation; Cox Proportional Hazards

### Image Analysis for Automatic Inspection of Electronics

This project involved using **Python** and image analysis methods to help inspect electronic components and to automatically identify defects on a printed circuit board. The techniques used included feature detection, convolution neural networks, image registration and more. Some of the **Python** libraries used include NumPy, OpenCV, Keras and Matplotlib.
