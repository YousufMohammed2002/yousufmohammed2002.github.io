# Data Science Portfolio 

## Hi There! Here are some of the projects that I have done through my data science degree at the University of Warwick

### Psychological Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic

In the academic year 2022/2023, I embarked on a compelling data science project that aimed to unravel the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a specific focus on the mental health of UK university students. Supervised by Dr Martine Barons at the University of Warwick, this project employed advanced data science methodologies to analyze and interpret the effects of the pandemic on the well-being of students.

Most of this was done using **R** to clean and preprocess the data, followed by visualisation and statistical model fitting. Further, a **Bayesian Network** (Bayes Net) was also used to model the data using the Netica software.

#### Results

The analysis revealed noteworthy findings, indicating that the mental health of UK university students was adversely affected in 2020 compared to previous years. Demographic factors such as age, gender, and changes in working hours in Australia were also identified as significant contributors to variations in mental well-being.

### Survival Analysis of Patients in the METABRIC Study

Using **R** to perform missing data analysis and survival analysis of data about breast cancer. The main aim is to model the time until an event has happened and to find relationships between different clinical factors and the patient's length of survival.

This project allowed me to follow my interest in medical statistics and apply my knowledge and skills in an area of importance for many people.

### Image Analysis for Automatic Inspection of Electronics

This project involved using **Python** and image analysis methods to help inspect electronic components and to automatically identify defects on a printed circuit board. The techniques used included feature detection (using SIFT), convolution neural networks, image registration and more. Some of the **Python** libraries used include **NumPy, OpenCV, Keras and Matplotlib**.

### Analysis of Stop and Search Police Data in the United Kingdom

This project was an evidence-based study of sex and ethnic biases in police interventions in Great Britain. Specifically, three Police Forces were analysed: West Yorkshire, Essex and Cleveland. This was done using **R** to model and visualise real stop and search data from the police to understand if stop and search rates were the same for different ethnic groups and if the proportion of males and females being stopped by the police changed over time. This was done using examples **generalised linear models** (GLMs) such as **logistic regression** and Poisson GLMs

## Executive Summary 
• The rate of stop-and-searches for black individuals is highest for all three forces (Cleveland, Essex and West Yorkshire) in the 2019/20 financial year, followed by Mixed/Other ethnic groups in Cleveland and Essex, and Asian individuals in West Yorkshire

• White individuals have the lowest stop-and-search rate across all three forces

• Rates of stop-and-searches have increased since 2017/18 for the entire UK population

• Essex has the highest rates of stop-and-searches compared to Cleveland and West Yorkshire for all ethnic groups, particularly with black individuals having a rate over five times higher than white individuals in 2019/2020.

• The proportion of females being stopped and searched is significantly lower compared to males, however, the proportion has been increasing slightly from 2017 to 2022
